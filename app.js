//Add a 7th question that has multiple possible correct answers that are stored in an array.
//Give the user 6 attempts to guess the correct answer.
//The guesses will end once the user guesses a correct answer or they run out of attempts.
//Display all the possible correct answers to the user.
//Consider using a loop of some sort for this question.
//As a user, I would like to know my final score so that I can know how well I did.
//Keep track of the total number of correct answers. At the end tell them how many they got correct out of the 7 questions asked.
